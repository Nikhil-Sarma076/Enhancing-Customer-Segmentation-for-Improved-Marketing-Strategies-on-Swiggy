#SWIGGY DATA ANALYSIS



## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a research project focused on creating an intelligent system for Swiggy. The primary objective is to predict high-value orders using various machine learning methods, including XG Boost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. The research emphasizes thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and categorical variable encoding, primarily implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library.

## Key Features

- Utilization of machine learning models: XG Boost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.
- Emphasis on data preprocessing, including feature engineering and categorical variable encoding.
- Implementation in Python using the scikit-learn library.
- Comprehensive analysis of model performance and comparison.
- Significant insights into factors influencing high-value orders.

## Results

After randomised search hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model achieved a noteworthy 82.44% testing accuracy, outperforming the Decision Tree model at 80.70%. Additionally, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression provided distinct viewpoints, with accuracies of 53.68%, 73.87%, and 82.44%, respectively.

## Recommendations for Swiggy

This research not only demonstrates the effective application of various machine learning models but also extracts valuable insights into the factors influencing high-value orders. The study aims to provide practical suggestions for enhancing Swiggy's business approach, leading to increased consumer involvement and stimulating income growth for both Swiggy and its affiliated eateries.
